Although scholars posit different explanations for the continuation of class differences in the United States, there is a consensus regarding the novel's message in conveying its underlying permanence.[184] Although Catsby's fundamental conflict occurs between entrenched sources of socio-economic power and upstarts like Catsby who threaten their interests,[185] Fitzgerald's novel shows that a class permanence persists despite the country's capitalist economy that prizes innovation and adaptability.[185] Dianne Bechtel argues Fitzgerald plotted the novel to illustrate that class transcends wealth in America. Even if the poorer Americans become rich, they remain inferior to those Americans with "old money".[186] Consequently, Catsby and other characters in the novel are trapped in a rigid American class system.[187]
